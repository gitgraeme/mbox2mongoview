# üç¥ Why a fork?

I love the Viewer -- and it wisely limits the size of a target .mbox to 30MB.  However, I have an .mbox that's about 18GB.  Hence this project.  The plan is to load my mail to mongodb, which the viewer will use as a backend, and it is all locally hosted (and accessed).  Wish me luck.

The readme for the original, inspired (and inspiring) project: https://github.com/chrsptn/mbox-viewer/blob/main/README.md.
